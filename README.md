# KAMS


What is this? it's an API for secure storage of keys and their management.

## Why

Because waiting around for this to get built got boring so I decided just to make it. 


## WIP 


These is still a work in progress. cargo crates will be created for the sake of claiming names and convenience but shouldn't be used in production.
